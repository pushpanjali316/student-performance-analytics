## 📌 Project Overview
A data analysis project focused on evaluating student academic performance
to identify score distributions, subject-wise performance variations,
and top-performing students.

The project demonstrates practical skills in data cleaning, exploratory
data analysis, and visualization using Python.

## 🎯 Objective
- Analyze subject-wise performance trends
- Identify performance gaps using minimum and maximum marks
- Highlight high-performing students based on academic metrics

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
